# In-Game UI Improvement Ideas (Deferred)

Keep the game faithful to DOS original. These are future ideas only.

## Config Menu (in-canvas)
- Group 19 options into categories (Game, Visual, Audio, Advanced)
- Add presets: "Quick Game", "Classic", "Chaos"
- Make player names editable (currently read-only)
- Mouse/click support for config navigation

## HUD (in-canvas)
- Visual distinction for low HP beyond color shift
- Weapon name overflow handling on small canvas

## Shop (in-canvas)
- Item descriptions / tooltips showing blast radius, damage
- Visual feedback on purchase (flash, sound)
- Undo/confirmation on buys
- Smarter AI auto-purchase (currently only missiles + nukes + shields)

## Round Over / Game Over (in-canvas)
- Animated score transitions
- Replay highlights or kill stats
- War quote presentation with typewriter effect
